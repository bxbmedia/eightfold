# Portfolio Template

This is your portfolio page template. Follow these steps to create your portfolio.

## Quick Start

1. **Copy this folder** (don't edit it directly):
   ```bash
   cp -r portfolios/template portfolios/[your-name]
   # Example: cp -r portfolios/template portfolios/jordan
   ```

2. **Edit your copy** at `portfolios/[your-name]/index.html`

3. **Update the landing page** (`index.html` in root) with your info

## What to Replace

Open `index.html` and replace everything in `[brackets]`:

| Placeholder | Replace with |
|-------------|--------------|
| `[Your Name]` | Your actual name |
| `[X]` | First letter of your name (for avatar) |
| `[Your role or tagline...]` | A short description of yourself |
| `[YOUR-REPO-URL]` | Link to your demo project on GitHub |
| `[Describe your demo project...]` | 2-3 paragraphs about your project |
| `[Technology 1]`, etc. | Your actual tech stack |
| `[What did you learn...]` | Your reflection on the project |

## Sections to Complete

1. **Project Overview** — What your demo does and who it's for
2. **README** — Your demo project's README content
3. **AI Context** — Your claude.md file and how you used it
4. **Tech Stack** — Minimum 3 technologies used
5. **Reflection** — What you learned

## Tips

- Use the browser dev tools to preview your changes
- Keep paragraphs short and scannable
- Code blocks are pre-formatted — paste code directly
- Test your links before committing

## When You're Done

1. Update your card on the main landing page
2. Commit with a clear message
3. Push and open a PR

Good luck!
